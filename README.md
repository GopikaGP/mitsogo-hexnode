# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

FOR RUNNING COMMAND : npm run dev

Custom CSS Overrides and Styling and rsponsive in banner section
Challenge: When overriding default Bootstrap styles, itâ€™s easy to lose track of the customizations, which can cause confusion later.
Solution: In your documentation, create a Custom Styles section where you list all custom CSS classes (e.g., .navbar_bg, .btn-danger). Explain why these were added or modified and include specific values for properties like color, padding, and margins.
